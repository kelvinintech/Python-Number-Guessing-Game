<p><h4>Hey everyone, it's @kelvinintech!</h4> Welcome to my Number Guessing Game repository. This simple Python game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback after each guess, helping players refine their guesses until they find the correct number. This project is not just about playing a game but also about learning Python programming concepts. Each line of code is extensively commented to explain its purpose and functionality. This commentary serves a dual purpose: to guide new learners through the code and to reinforce the importance of understanding each line when learning to program. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand basic Python operations or simply want to play a fun game, this repository is a great starting point. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!</p>
